                        Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
                        unorthographic life One
                        day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for
                        the far World of
                        Grammar.

                        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia,
                        there live the
                        blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics,
                        a large language
                        ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary
                        regelialia.

                        The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
                        Question Marks and
                        devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. On her way she met a copy.
                        The copy warned the
                        Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times
                        and everything that
                        was left from its origin would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn
                        around and return to
                        its own, safe country.
